Meteor Dodge Instructions

How to start:
Run the SpaceDodgeGame.java file. A window will appear with a "Start Game" button. Click the button to begin.

How to play:
1. You control the Blue Square (The Ship) at the bottom of the screen.
2. Use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys on your keyboard to move.
3. Red Circles (Meteors) will fall from the top of the screen.
4. If a Meteor hits your Ship, the game ends.
5. Your score increases the longer you survive.

Scoring:
When you die, a popup will ask for your name. If you enter a valid name, your score is saved to 'highscores.txt'. 
If you do not enter a name, the game will catch the custom error and save you as "Anonymous" to prevent a crash.
